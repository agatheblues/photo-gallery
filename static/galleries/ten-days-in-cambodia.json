      "description": "Our journey starts with the temples of Angkor, near Siem Reap. We wake up in the middle of the night, get in our tuk-tuk with our local driver. We should get there early to catch the sun rising on Angkor Wat. I remember having trouble shooting a picture that does not capture a handful of tourists. We spend the day, under the heat, visiting the temples one after the other. After the lunch, and still a couple of temples to see, we're heading home. The jet-lag, the sudden unbearable 15°C of difference in temperature, and us waking up at dawn defeated us. On the way home, a thundershower cool us down for a moment.",

We are lucky enough to be just the two of us in the class, and the cook is all sweetness with us.",

The air pollution, the chaos of the traffic, the apparent mess in the streets. I realise the strictness and uniformity of our cities, back in Europe.
